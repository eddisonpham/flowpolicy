# Docs changelog

## 2026-10-18: Stage 1

- Added `00_overview.md` (day-one checklist, scope, success criteria template, corrections to the brief).
- Added `02_environment_setup.md` (compatibility matrix, pitfalls, install steps, gates G1 to G9, results table, references).
- Findings that change the brief: PyTorch is at 2.14.1 and no longer ships CUDA 12.8 wheels (use `cu130`); ROS 2 Lyrical Luth now exists; PyTorch 2.13 stopped bundling `ptxas` in cu13 builds.
- Open: items listed under "Not verified in Stage 1" in `02_environment_setup.md` section 10.
- Next: Stage 2 (ADR-001 to ADR-008).

## 2026-10-18: Stage 2 (consolidated)

- Added 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07. ADRs for D1-D10 are consolidated in 06; reading list and packaging are in 07.
- Diffusion Policy recipe sourced from replicating papers and the LeRobot port, not the original paper (flagged [S]/[U]); agent must confirm against the paper before E0.
- Unverified items remain tagged [U] (pi0 timestep distribution, ACT details, dataset URLs/licenses, async chunking literature, Triton pin, uv/Docker/Nsight specifics).
